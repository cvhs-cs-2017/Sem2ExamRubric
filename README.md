# Sem2ExamRubric
*BELOW Is the Rubric the students SHOULD have followed.  Go through each step and determine how many points they earned.*
Record the score in the file marked SCORE

**Step 1:** The student created a file named MyFile.py *(5 points)*
       
The student created a file but did not capitolize M and F in MyFile.py *(4 points)*

The student created a file named something else, but it included .py making it a python file *(3 points)*

The stduetn created a file but it was not a python file *(2 points)*

The student did not create a file *(0 points)*


**Step 2:**  Count the number of commits in the file and award 1 point per commit.  They can earn up to *(10 points)*.  


**Step 3:** In MyFile.py, define the following functions:  Copy each of these functions and run them in git-bash or the python shell.  Be sure to import turtle and create a turlte to test DrawRectangle() and DrawPoly()
**  # AddTen(n):**  Adds 10 to the parameter n and returns the result *(5 points)*
  
The Student created a function called AddTen(n) that correclty returns a result 10 more than any input (n): (5 points) 
 
The stufent created a function but it did not work for random values of n (2 - 3 points)

The student did not create a function called AddTen(n) (0 points)
 
** # DrawRectangle(Anyturtle, l, w): ** Self Explanitory *(5 points)*

The Student created a function called DrawRecantlge() that took in 3 parameters and created a rectnalge *(5 points)*

The studnet created a function Drawrectangle but did not allow l and w to vary (no parameters) *(2 - 3 points)*    

The student did not create a functuon that drew a rectangle *(0 points)*


** # DrawPoly(Anyturtle, n): ** Will draw a regular polygon with 'n' sides of *(5 points)*

The student created a function that would create a REGULAR polygon with any number of sides (n) : *(5 points)*

The student created a function that took in input (n) but did not draw a regular polygon with n sides *(2 -3 points)*

The student did not create a functuon that would draw a regular polygon at all *(0 points)*


**Step 4:** Check the files and see if the student completed the code in the following Files:
  # Function.py  **10 Points MAX)**

The student completed both tasks successfully *(10 points)

The student completed the first task successfully *(5 points)

The student completed the second task successfully *(5 points

The student did not complete either task *(0 points)
  
 ** # RangeFunction.py ** **15 Points Max**
  
The student completed all three tasks and the code works *(15 points)
  
The student completed all three tasks but one of them does not work *(10 points)
  
The student completed all three tasks but 2 of them do not work *(5 points)
  
The student did not complete one or more task *(5 points)
  
The student did not complete any tasks or do any work *(0 points)
  
 ** # Loops.py ** **10 points Max**
  
The student completed boht tasks *(10 points)
  
The student completed 1 of the tasks or completed boht but one did not work properly *(5 points)
  
The student did not coplete either task or they both did not workproperly *(0 points)
  
 ** # Turtle.py **(*Will require you do step 1 and 2 first*)  **10 points Max**
  
The student imported the required function from MyFile.py and completed the tasks. *(10 points)*

The student completed the tasks but did NOT import their functions from MyFile.py *(5 points)*

The studet did not complete the tasks completely but one of the tasks are complete *(5 points)*

The stduent did not complete either task *(0 points)


 ** # Encrypt.py ** **10 points Max** . 
  
  Test the code on this string: "I love Computer Science!"

  The student created a code that will remove all vowles from ANY string.  Test should print:" lv CmptrScnc!"
  

Student code correclty returns the stirng above and they created their own Encription function *(10 points)*

Student code works but they did not create their own Encryption code *(5 points)*

Student created their own Enctryption code but did not successful remove vowel from the string above: *(5 points)* 

Student did not complete either task: *(0 points)        



**# Step 5:** **OPTIONAL**  Do the extra credit assignment.  You can also finish this at home and turn it in by lunchtime on Friday.  Both problems are worth **5 EC points MAX.**

Check their code to run the input (101) and (1101) and see if the return is (5) and (13) respectively.  

For the second code enter in the number (5) and then (13) separately and make sure the return is (101) and (1101).

If both succeed:  *(5 points)*

If one succeeds *(3 points)

If none succeed but they tried *(1 point)*
